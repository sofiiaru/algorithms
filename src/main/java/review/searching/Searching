Search algorithms

-------Unordered collection or unknown order---------
Linear Search (Sequential)
- if collection is ordered or unordered is not known
- scan complete array to see if element is there
- time complexity O(n)

--------Ordered collection----------
Binary Search
- need sorted array
- repeatedly divides the search interval in half
- O(log2n)

Ternary Search
- similar to Binary Search but instead of two parts the data is divided into 3 parts
- O(log3n)
- makes too many comparisons


Jump Search
- better than linear but worse than binary
- for sorted arrays
- check fewer elements by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements in place of searching all elements
- O(sqrt n) time complexity and O(1) space

Exponential Search
- start with a small range, if item doesn't exist double the search size
- O(logn)
