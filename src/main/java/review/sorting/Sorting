Brute Force
-- Monkey Sort/ Stupid sort/ Bogo sort - shuffle until sorted
-- Selection Sort - sorts an array by repeatedly finding the min element from unsorted part and putting it in the beginning (swap)
Time complexity O(n^2) because O(n) passes and O(n) comparisons --> worse than bubble sort in best case;
