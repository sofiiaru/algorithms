************** Brute Force ***************

-- Monkey Sort/ Stupid sort/ Bogo sort - shuffle until sorted

-- Selection Sort - sorts an array by repeatedly finding the min element from unsorted part and putting it in the beginning (swap)
Time complexity O(n^2) because O(n) passes and O(n) comparisons --> worse than bubble sort in best case;

-- Bubble Sort
- start from beginning and compare ith with irh+1 element
- swap if needed
- repeat first 2 steps arr.length times
- O(n^2)

*************** Decrease and Conquer *************
- incremental (inductive) approach
- can be top-down (recursive) and bottom-up (non-recursive)

-- Insertion Sort - decrease by a const
- array is virtualy split into sorted and unsorted part
- values from unsorted part are picked and inserted into correct position in the sorted part
- O(n^2)

-- Binary Search - decrease by a const factor
-- Euclidean Algorithm (GCD) - variable size decrease

************** Divide and Conquer *************

-- MergeSort
- break down the list into smaller and smaller sublists
- sort sublists and merge them to produce sorted sublists
- O(n logn)
- requires additional space!!!
